## 🎬 Trailer Video Audio (The Hooks)

### **What It Is:**
The original audio from the movie trailer itself.

### **Examples:**
- 💥 Explosion sound effects
- 🗣️ Character dialogue ("I am Iron Man")
- 🎵 Trailer music (epic drums, suspenseful violins)
- 🚗 Sound effects (car chase, gunshots)

### **How Screndly Uses It:**
- **Without AI:** Uses generic moments (first 5s, middle, last 5s)
- **With AI:** Analyzes trailer and picks BEST moments:
  - Opening: Explosion at 5.3s
  - Mid: Dramatic dialogue at 72.5s
  - Ending: Title card reveal at 142.8s

### **Duration:**
- Short bursts (3-7 seconds)
- Strategic placements
- Creates excitement and authenticity

### **Why It Matters:**
Gives viewers a taste of the actual movie audio - makes it feel official and exciting!

## 🎤 Voiceover (Your Narration)

### **What It Is:**
Your recorded voice explaining the movie.

### **Examples:**
- "Coming this December..."
- "From the director of Avatar..."
- "The epic conclusion to the trilogy..."
- "Starring Chris Hemsworth and Zendaya..."

### **How Screndly Uses It:**
- Plays during most of the video
- AI extracts movie titles automatically
- Syncs captions to your words
- Main storytelling element

### **Duration:**
- 20-45 seconds typically
- Can be longer for monthly compilations (3-4 minutes)

### **Why It Matters:**
Tells the story and provides context. This is YOUR voice promoting the movie!

---

## 🎵 Background Music (The Atmosphere)

### **What It Is:**
Cinematic soundtrack that plays throughout.

### **Examples:**
- Epic orchestral music
- Tension-building strings
- Dramatic drums
- Emotional piano

### **How Screndly Uses It:**
- Plays continuously under everything
- Auto-ducks (lowers volume) when voiceover plays
- Raises volume during pauses
- Ties the whole video together

### **Duration:**
- Entire video length
- Loops if needed

### **Why It Matters:**
Without it, your video sounds empty during voiceover sections. Music = professional polish!

```

### **Legend:**
- `████` = Audio playing at high volume
- `░░░░` = Audio playing at low/no volume

### **What's Happening:**
1. **0-5s:** Trailer hook loud, music quiet
2. **5-20s:** Voiceover loud, music ducked, trailer silent
3. **20-25s:** Trailer hook loud again, music quiet
4. **25-30s:** Voiceover finale, music crescendo

## 🎯 Auto-Ducking Modes

### **Partial (Recommended):**
```
Voiceover plays: Music → 30% volume
Voiceover stops: Music → 70% volume
Result: Music always audible, voice clear
```

### **Full Mute:**
```
Voiceover plays: Music → 0% volume (silence)
Voiceover stops: Music → 100% volume
Result: Dramatic contrast, very clear voice
```

### **Adaptive:**
```
Loud voiceover section: Music → 20% volume
Quiet voiceover section: Music → 50% volume
Result: Smart balancing based on voice energy
```

## 🧠 How AI Enhances Trailer Audio

### **Without AI Analysis:**
```
System picks trailer audio moments based on time:
- Opening: 0-5 seconds (whatever is there)
- Mid: Middle of trailer (could be boring)
- Ending: Last 5 seconds (might be silence)

Problem: Could grab bad moments!
```

### **With AI Analysis:**
```
Google Video Intelligence analyzes entire trailer:
- Detects 47 scenes
- Labels each (explosion, dialogue, title card)
- Scores intensity (0.2 to 0.95)
- Identifies dialogue vs. silence
- Selects BEST moments for hooks

Result: Always grabs exciting moments!
```

### **Example Comparison:**

| Without AI | With AI |
|-----------|---------|
| Opening: Static logo (boring) ❌ | Opening: Explosion scene ✅ |
| Mid: Character walking (meh) ❌ | Mid: "I am inevitable" line ✅ |
| Ending: Silence (bad) ❌ | Ending: Title card reveal ✅ |
